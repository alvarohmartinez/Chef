# chef

Chef it's a small CMS developed using Django 4.0, that allows you signup, login, and post (CRUD) your recipes. It was developed initially using a MySQL database, but you can change to other, if desirer. If you have some question about how to change the database, I suggest you access https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/databases/.
